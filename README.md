# Vite-React--redux-tailwind-JavaScript

=> install all dependency using "yarn" or "npm i" <br />

=> run project using "yarn dev" or "npm run dev" <br />


## Guideline:


=> You can see menu and submenu from the left sidebar section. <br />
=> and you can a navbar in the top of the main workspace. <br />
=> in the navbar epic virtual solution button is for redirecting to the landing page. <br />

## Focus point: 
=> your selected component will be rendered to the right side workspace <br />
=> you can add products to cart and also remove products from the cart in the Mobile page <br />
=> you can see your added products by clicking the My Cart button in the right corner of the navbar. <br /> 
=> inside of my cart page, you can also remove remove item from your cart lists <br />

## Extra work:
=> we are saving our cart items on our local machine; if you refresh your page, your cart items won't be removed
