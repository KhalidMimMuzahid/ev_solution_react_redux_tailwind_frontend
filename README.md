### install all dependency using "yarn" or "npm i"

### run project using "yarn dev" or "npm run dev"


## Guideline:


### You can see menu and submenu from the left sidebar section 
### and you can a navbar in the top of the main workspace
### in the navbar epic virtual solution button is for redirecting to the landing page

## Focus point: 
### your selected component will be rendered to the right side workspace
### you can add products to cart and also remove products from the cart in the Mobile page
### you can see your added products by clicking the My Cart button in the right corner of the navbar. 
### inside of my cart page, you can also remove remove item from your cart lists

## Extra work:
### we are saving our cart items on our local machine; if you refresh your page, your cart items won't be removed
